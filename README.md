# feelthespace---php

In this project I have mainly created an online platform for space. An E-commerce which contains products about space, a FORUM where they can join the CHAT for conversations about space.
The programming languages ​​used in this project are:
In E-commerce for Front-end I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, also Google Firebase and for the Back-end I used php and mySql also for the email notifications I used phpmailer thus creating a dynamic web application.
For the Live Chat part I integrated tawk.to.
Also for the Forum part I used REACT and some other libraries ... including Google Login and Facebook Login and the chatengine.io framework.




Feel the Space is a project that has space as its main theme.
This platform provides accurate and fast information about the most important events in the field of Planetary Space and various events around it.
The index (front page) is very welcoming with an animation through JavaScript and enables access to other parts of the web such as the Forum and Shop. And via EmailJS via JavaScript sends all Contact Us messages,
It also offers an e-Commerce with a variety of products around the space. This online store also contains the administrative part (/ admin) which makes it even easier to manage, add, change products and also manage sales, customer requests, view searches from customers, add news and much more! Possibility to place discounts on products etc ... Also the peculiarity is that it also uses a very good system of informing customers about the orders they place. Thus, through phpmailer, every order is notified to the buyer via email and the seller is also notified that a product has been ordered.
The simple and compatible design allows the consumer to browse among many products, add them to the wish list (Wish List) to have them ready or add them to the cart (Cart) so that he can buy them immediately!
A Search Engine which allows through keywords the user can find the product he wants.
Perhaps one of the most important things in an e-Commerce is the Purchase step, but Feel the Space shop has managed this step very well making it one of the easiest where most information is stored and filled in automatically and you just have to choose the payment method!
Order History is one of the parts that Feel the Space shop offers. where each user is saved purchase data whenever he needs to review them.
We also offer a Subscription (Newsletter) where only email is required and you will receive the latest offers from us to NEVER miss them :)! (It is also worth noting that the Newsletter is managed through the Admin section which allows sending an email with certain content via a Form).
What is more important than the customer being able to get help online in case of need for choice between products or any help therefore we have integrated a functional Live Chat where you can contact directly with a professional from the store.
It is worth mentioning because the web is created piece-by-piece
(parts) which is a preferred method in large projects so that the code is not repeated but called through the include () function ...
Another important part is the forum which aims to unite people with common interests, ie "space".
The forum is a Chat Engine like WhatsApp where it enables group chats.
It first asks the user to log in through their Google Account or Facebook Account accounts and then sends it to the Dashboard where they can create their own Chats with people they like or be invited to a group.
It works perfectly and quickly, sends messages quickly and accurately, allows sending Files and Photos and much more.
This Chat Engine was created through REACT and several other libraries. Also using Google Firebase Auth for Login. And also using Chatengine.io for the ChatApp part.
So it is a dynamic web that offers content and ease of use for users and also offers very easy and good management for administrators and platform managers!
